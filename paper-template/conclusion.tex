\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this project, we implemented thread safety violation detection in Java as it
is one of the most cruicial research issues nowaday due to the availablity of
multi-core programs. In addition to the implementation of the existing TSVD, we address few of the
setbacks of this technique and we finally give a solution to handle that TSV points. In our experiments, we consider different types of dataset to understand the varsetellity of the implemented TSVD technique with its extension. Most of the cases, our result produce satisfactory results with some minor false positives. In the future, our plan is to address all those such as adaptive delay settings, removal of synchronized keywords from our consideration, parameters fine-tuning for different threshold values and so on.

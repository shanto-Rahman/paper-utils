\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this project, we have implemented an existing thread safety violation
detection technique in Java as it is one of the most crucial research topics
nowaday due to the availability of multi-core programs. In addition to the
implementation of the existing TSVD, we address a few of the setbacks of this
technique and we give an enhanced solution to handle those TSV points. In our
experiments, we consider different types of dataset to understand the
versatility of the implemented TSVD technique with its extension. Most of the
cases, our results produce satisfactory results with some minor false
positives.

In the future, our plan is to address all those and additionally
work on a few of the algorithms such as adaptive delay settings, extra caring
if synchronized keywords exist in the source code, parameters fine-tuning for
different threshold values and so on.

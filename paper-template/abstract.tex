Data race is a very common problem in any multi-threading applications where
one shared variable is accesssed by multiple threads simultaneously. This often
makes a program's outcomes inconsistent which makes developers puzzled. In this
project, our goal is to automatically find out any data race situation occured
in the program. Hence, we implement a thread safety violation detection tool
namely \Toolname{TSVD} to inform the developers if their code suffers from data
race situation.  In experiment, we considered few known projects which have
data-race situation. Later, we also considered few unknown github projects to
verify our implementation. For both cases, we observed that our TSVD can detect
data race situation. JACONTEBE bechmark dataset which have data race issues.

\section{Enhancement of TSVD}
\label{sec:enhancement_tsvd}
\input{code/code1}
In this project, initially we implement the TSVD paper \cite{li2019efficient} and run different
subject projects on it. We observed that the TSVD can handle the thread safety
API if it finds those in the code but it measurebly fails when the source code has
some primitive types of shared objects. For example, any shared integer
variable, string variable and so on. Meanwhile, when we manually inspect the
source code to find the existence of data-race situation, we identify these are
very commonly happening in the source code shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dataRace2}. Hence, we modify the existing TSVD with the
incorporation of these variable assignment operations.

In order to detect more data-race situations, we modify the byte-code
instrumentation to get assignment operation by PUTSTATIC, GETSTATIC and
PUTFIELD, GETFIELD opcodes from the Java bytecode stack trace. Then we call
different proxy methods to handle those data race situation types by our TSVD. Basically these four operations were missing in the TSVD and hence we incorporate those to detect Java thread safety violations.

To evaluate our claim, we consider the JACONTEBE benchmark (a dataset with
different concurrency bugs) and run the both existing and enhanced TSVD. Table
\ref{table:TSVD_comparison} represents the four different JACONTEBE
projects and the number of bugs found by the original TSVD compared to
our enhanced TSVD technique. Results indicate that
original TSVD fails every time for these types (similar to the Figure~\ref{fig:dataRace2}) of the datarace situation whereas our enhanced TSVD can detect the bugs.
